1. A simple calculator application that asks the user to enter two numbers and the operation (e.g. +, -, x, etc.) that theyâ€™d like to perform on the numbers.

2. It displays the answer to the equation. 

3. Every equation entered by the user is written to a text file. 

4. Using defensive programming the program is robust and handles unexpected events and user inputs.

5. The program gives the user the option to either enter two numbers and an operator, like before, or to read all of the equations from a new txt file (the user adds the name of the txt file as an input) and prints out all of the equations together with the results. 

6. We use defensive coding to ensure that the program does not crash if the file does not exist and that the user is prompted again to enter the name of the file.
